My journey into web technologies began as a hobby â€” helping with my wife's projects, exploring SEO, contextual advertising, and web design. Over time, I discovered that frontend development inspires me the most. Today, I'm focused on deepening my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to grow as a professional developer.
